"When working on more sophisticated problems, you will likely find that "
"you frequently need to access results from previous computations. As we "
"have already seen, you can simply recall results from the result window. "
"However, SpeedCrunch also offers another more powerful way: Variables. "
"Variables allow you to store and recall any value, by assigning it a "
"name. Variables are defined using the :samp:`{variable}={value}` syntax::"

"Just as you can define your own variables, it is also possible to define "

"Some users (especially mathematicians or physicists) may prefer to use "

msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/advanced.rst:127
msgid ""
"In SpeedCrunch (unlike in textbook notation), prefixes can be used on "
"their own. This limitation (or feature, depending on your point of view) "
"means that their use follows the same rules of precedence as any other "
"mathematical operation. For instance, if you intend to express the unit "
"'newtons per centimeter', don't simply type ``newton / centi meter`` -- "
"this will be interpreted as ``(newton / centi) meter``! Instead, make the"
" order explicit by using ``newton / (centi meter)``."

"An important feature of SpeedCrunch's unit system is *dimensional "
"checking*. Simply put, it prevents comparing apples and pears: If you try"
" to convert seconds to meters, SpeedCrunch will complain, stating that "
"the dimensions of ``second`` and ``meter`` do not match. Indeed, the "
"dimension of ``second`` is *time*, while ``meter`` denotes a *length*, "
"thus they cannot be compared, added, etc. When adding, multiplying, or "
"otherwise manipulating units, SpeedCrunch will track the dimension and "
"raise an error if it detects an invalid operation. For instance if you "
"type ``meter^2``, the result will be a quantity with the dimension "
"*length*\\ :sup:`2` which can only be compared to other quantities with "
"the same dimension. Currently, the available dimensions and their "
"associated primitive units are:"
