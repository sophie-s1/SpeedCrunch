"All color scheme files must have the extension ``.json``. The file name "
"without the extension will be displayed in the color scheme menu "
"(:menuselection:`Settings --> Display --> Color Scheme`). The contents of"
" the color scheme directory are retrieved when SpeedCrunch is launched, "
"so to have it pick up a newly-added color scheme file, it is necessary to"
" restart the application. However, color scheme files are always reloaded"
" when a color scheme is selected in the menu; that means after making "
"changes to a color scheme file, re-selecting it in SpeedCrunch will "
"reload the color scheme and show the changes. This allows for quick "
"feedback when editing color schemes."

"Here, the keys are *roles*, each referring to elements in the SpeedCrunch"
" history view and expression editor that can be colored. The values "

"HTML-style ``#RRGGBB`` definitions, using two hexadecimal digits per "
"color component as in the example."

"Any unknown roles will be ignored. If a role is not defined in the color "
"scheme, corresponding elements will be using the application's default "
"text color (or, for background roles, the default background color). "
"However, if the file is not valid JSON or otherwise does not follow the "
"format described above, the color scheme will not load and SpeedCrunch "
"will use the fallback colors for every element."
