"Welcome to the SpeedCrunch manual! SpeedCrunch is a high-precision "
"scientific desktop calculator. It features a syntax-highlighted "
"scrollable display and is designed to be fully used via keyboard. Some "
"distinctive features are auto-completion of functions and variables, a "
"formula book, and quick insertion of constants from various fields of "
"knowledge. It is available for Windows, OS X, and Linux in a number of "
"languages. We hope you have fun with SpeedCrunch!"
